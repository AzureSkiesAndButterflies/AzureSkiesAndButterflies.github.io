# Ways To Help The Environment A Better Place! 

## Overview 

This website's purpose's to help spread awareness and the cause of the environment and its problems that we've known about for decades. Climate change, deforestation, pollution, waste disposal, and many more are supposed to we're supposed to discuss. Since these problems that I mentioned are severe if we don't do something about them. And I'm assuming you might have already seen the news about scientists getting arrested for protesting against authorities about climate change. And I'm here to help by making ways to help our environment.

## List of ways to help

### Reduce, reuse, recycle

Reduce, reuse, and recycle are ways of disposing of waste and protecting the environment. First, we must reduce the amount of waste we make. Think thoroughly about purchasing any product you need or want to avoid having excess that'll be a waste. Second, reuse items and products that we can use more than once, unlike one-use products. Avoid using plastic and paper utensils for eating use, reusable utensils. And lastly, recycling the products you use rather than throwing them away would be a waste. Fix something rather than replacing it, sort out which products you use that are non-recyclable and recyclable, avoid shredding paper, and keep recyclable products clean.
