# Ways To Help The Environment A Better Place! 

## Overview 

This website's purpose's to help spread awareness and the cause of the environment and its problems that we've known about for decades. Climate change, deforestation, pollution, waste disposal, and many more are supposed to we're supposed to discuss. Since these problems that I mentioned are severe if we don't do something about them. And I'm assuming you might have already seen the news about scientists getting arrested for protesting against authorities about climate change. And I'm here to help by making ways to help our environment.

## List of ways to help

### Reduce, reuse, recycle

Reduce, reuse, and recycle are ways of disposing of waste and protecting the environment. First, we must reduce the amount of waste we make. Think thoroughly about purchasing any product you need or want to avoid having excess that'll be a waste. Second, reuse items and products that we can use more than once, unlike one-use products. Avoid using plastic and paper utensils for eating use, reusable utensils. And lastly, recycling the products you use rather than throwing them away would be a waste. Fix something rather than replacing it, sort out which products you use that are non-recyclable and recyclable, avoid shredding paper, and keep recyclable products clean.

### Download and use apps that help the environment 

These applications I found and researched are reliable and safe to use:
#### - Ecosia 
Ecosia is a German search engine founded in Berlin. It gives away 80% of its proceeds to reforestation-focused charitable groups. It calls itself a social enterprise, claims to be CO2-neutral, and claims to support complete financial transparency and user privacy. Ecosia has earned B Lab certification, demonstrating that it meets the organization's standards for accountability, sustainability, and performance. The company claims to have planted over 149 million trees since its founding in May 2022.
#### - Ocean Hero
Ocean Hero is a search engine dedicated to collecting plastic debris in the oceans, primarily bottle waste. The United Nations Head of Marine and Freshwater Branch has certified it. It's similar to Ecosia, a search engine that funds tree planting. Like most other search engines, and gives money by displaying advertisements alongside search results. It then uses the advertising income to collect plastic bottles from Southeast Asian waterways. It's also possible to install it as an extension, and its use provides financial assistance for cleaning plastic from the oceans. Many low-income people work with OceanHero to get paid from the revenue generated by ads appearing in search results and by removing trash from their local waters.
#### - Good Guide

### Spread awareness about the situation 

### Change to a new renewable energy source 

### Help plant trees around where you live
Helping plant trees so we can help end deforestation and make our area more lively. They also assist in the soil capture and store carbon. Despite not doing such an incredible job as oceans do, they absorb around 90% of all carbon emissions and then suffer the impacts of ocean acidification. And trees are significant to help stop climate change. Photosynthesis is when trees collect carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and store it in their wood. Trees and plants will store this carbon dioxide and reduce the amount of gas building up in our atmosphere, rapidly making our planet warmer.

### Donate if you can
The involvement of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in biodiversity protection is crucial. Because the bulk of these organizations relies on public donations to sustain their operations, fundraising performance is a factor in conservation outcomes. You can also donate anything you don't use. For example, donating your clothing will help keep landfills from expanding and usable materials from being discarded. Many mass-produced clothing lines have fibers that will never break down, no matter how long they are worn.
